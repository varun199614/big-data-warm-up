The first step of the project is to collect live tweets for this you must have a developer account. (script file is added to git)
Using PySpark ML libraries model were built, one is logistical regression to predict the sentiment of the text, and the other is Naive Bayes for category prediction.
We used Kaggle to get training data set for both models.
